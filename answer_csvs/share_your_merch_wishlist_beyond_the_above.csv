i tried to buy dave's shirt once and couldn't find officially licensed merch and all the unofficial merch was rated poorly. idk about now bc i don't spend money anymore to protest the american oligarchy so i haven't looked it up and will never spend my money especially on such frivolous things until i have my rights back. but i will say it's probably a bad business model to let other people make a killing off low quality merch of the most popular characters which associates your brand with low quality and loses you money. 
Maybe I would buy mp3s of official music.

Also ik this was previously mentioned, but i would go FERAL if the ost dropped on spotify/physically; i have been hoping for YEARS that they would do this and i was ECSTATIC when bowmanstuck was announced and bought the CD immediately.

"This is an extreme pipe dream but I would go apeshit for a major extension to 1. Alternian history (to have some background on the understated blood feud between the land and sea peoples, even though since they reproduce via an identical pathway it doesn't make that much sense), 2. leprechaun lore/culture, e.g. the charm matrix, and a contrasting lore dump about carapacian lore/culture and the similarities and differences between the two. Maybe that second thing could be shoehorned into ""Sburbology"" but I feel like it will be overshadowed/completely ignored in favor of dedicating 80% of the book to the classpect system. Same goes for denizens I guess, RIP. Show me the deals that Derse brokered with them, please god. ""Since time immemorial"" yeah I got that. Tell me about their government. Tell me about their civic systems please please please. Alternia too. Actually maybe not Alternia since I'm doing that myself. But you get the gist."

"i haven't visited the official merch store (barring topatoco) for a LONG time, so i don't know what they have now (i tried recently and the web site is broken and not loading the shop. what else is new. it's so sad to see what viz did to mspaintadventures site), but i would love if there were merch based off character wear i.e. derse/prospit PJs (i used to have a pair), god tier hoodies/outfits, scarves (lord english, roxy, eridan, etc). i used to have a lot of merch i got from back in the day, but it disappeared over the years plus most of the clothes wouldn't have fit me now anyway. i also would love more official posters (the ones on topatoco are alright, but not my style), shirts with the characters on them, and various trinkets like notebooks, keychains, bags, etc.

as to the buying (i don't stream) new hs albums, it's a maybe. i put no, but i'm open to the idea. same with the homestuck books, but only if there was hussie commentary. i'm contemplating getting the books at some point, only because of the commentary. also i would love HS cassettes because my car doesn't have a CD player and i can't be assed to install one in it."

"Hello! I actually wanted to add here that I bought and still have/use my quest bedding from byfansforfans! I have the Light version, which came with a pin as well that I also still have. I got it in 2020 for my 16th birthday (in April.) It is one of my favorite pieces of merch to date and I still lovingly and tenderly care for it, even though I sleep with it every night and wear the pin on my backpack (I even stitched up a small hole that was torn when I washed it.) Since then, I have shown it to many of my friends and most of them have confessed that they wish they could have purchased one as well. I think they would be incredibly popular if they were brought back, especially with the cute little pins! The mentioning of their existence in this census took me back and reminded me of how vibrant the merchandise landscape for homestuck used to be! I am looking forward to seeing (and purchasing) whatever might be introduced or brought back in the future! 

Besides that whole paragraph, I would love to see more merch of the Dancestors! They are a very big part of homestuck yet they seem to be uncharacteristic underrepresented. "

"Honestly I said no because I wanna but realistically probably wouldn't buy unless Homestuck came back to it's glory days, which, given Hussie… not happening. But. I wanted to say. The quest bed thing ? That's a terrible, terrible idea. I genuinely think there should be a ""Hell no"" option beyond just ""No"". Possibly even a ""Hell. Fucking. No."" after it. Remember this flash game in cannon where you play as Karkat, and Gamzee asks you a random question and you can pick your dialogue between ""No"" and ""Hell no"" ? This is it. Why did you list it first ? I don't wanna sleep in a death bed. No one sane should want to. This is atrocious. Borderline Calibornesque. Why. Dog why.

I expect them to make a killing among Homestuck fans, obviously. Please prove me wrong by not making them or failing to sell even a single one."

"This is a weird one but I'd buy a wallet that was shaped like a captcha card. But I think the best merch is trinket shit. pins and the like. plushes are good, the karkat plush is hilarious. lov e the bilboard hair. bring back the scalemates tho. or turn that bizzare flower pot tentacle creature rose made into a plush, that might sell. OH. Phone charms. I have a terezi phone charm i got from a fan artist at a con and i love it but i forgot the artists name and if i ever lose it i'm going to be distruaght beyond measure so. phone charms. also I clicked CD for the music up there but i would also purchase cassette. just because you dont have a tape player in your car doesnt mean i dont. its also more portable, carrying a tape player is more comfortable than carrying a cd walkman. those things are 1) hideous and 2) i'm always worried i'm going to break my discs. Never had that issue with tape. also doesnt what pumpkin no longer exist? This is research for mr. roach now. all hail or whatever. "

"This maybe a little out of line, but there should be a thing similar to The Fazbear Fanverse where popular fanworks and MSPFAs can be approved by official members of the Homestuck team to recieve physical books, merch, etc. I don't know I think it would be cool. The official team wouldn't even have to do book printing or merchandising for them. The creators of said fanwork could find their own ways of doing it, and the whole fanverse thing can just be a thing that checks a box that says ""Alright, you're allowed to make stuff like that."" idk its probably dumb but would be tooootally awesome, y'know?"

"- more character plushes please oh please (ik this is actively being worked on. I will buy. A L L )
- more clothes that aren't just regular shirts/hoodies (ie the kind of stuff WeLoveFine had)
- I wish there were more SBaHJ shirts, or really just SBaHJ stuff in general
- if they reran the scalemates I'd definitely buy at least one
- some figures would be nice, I'd jump at the chance to buy any
- any ""new"" official media that came in book form I'd probably want
- ik there are fanmade calendars, but if they made official ones again I'd buy one
- honestly they can sell any wacky shit they want. actually the wackier the better. I joined this fandom late and all the cool merch that once existed no longer does and I just want to. give the team my money in exchange for knickknacks. I would get excited for like anything new at this point I think tbh. like I'm anxiously awaiting the reveal of the new two plushies and will buy them no matter what.

I'd also kill for hussies notes to be leaked but I'm unsure if that even could be turned into merch as hussies notes are seemingly ""Wrote a bulletpoint list on a napkin once."" Comparing the ethos of the series then and now simply appeals to me.
