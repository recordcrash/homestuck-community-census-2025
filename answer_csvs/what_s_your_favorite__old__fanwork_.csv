"detective pony always on my mind. also theatre of coolty. just absolute must sees. also theres this fanfiction that was abandoned/deleted and i periodically try looking for it but just cant find it. but one day. we will be reunited. also a bunch of cosplays from back then, people were crazyy kt was awesome. and the polish translation of homestuck, helped me get into it since i didnt fully understand english back then. i remember opening mindfangs journal, looking at it, and immediately switching to hs polish translation lmao. i wasnt NOT reading all that. anyway im a translator by trade now. OH god and all the animations and amvs?? so sick. phemiecs songs..... broadway homestuck.........."

Of All This Blind Ambition 
"so there was this one fic where it was like focused on the pale romance but not in a genfic way. it was like, describing Palerom activities but in the style of a super explicit erotica. that was a really neat concept just like... how the way something is described can change how you interpret it. I've seen smut with dicks jizzing 500 yards less explicit than that. however my favorite one was actually probably the one where nepeta ships everyone. but if the palefic was complete it would be way up there. I got the vapors tbqh WAIT NO IT JUST SAID MUSIC DOWN BELOW I change my answer it is everything Homestuck that phemiec made"
